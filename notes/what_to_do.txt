rewrite:
    - backend: drf -> django ninja
    - frontend: structure rewrite, newer react router
    - docker: shave down container startup time
    - env variables: need to see which ones exist/are applicable, also need better documentation
    - env/docker files: big cleanup/reduction
    - postgres: move to different external port


backend envs:
    - DEBUG=True should mean using sqlite and nplusone, False would mean using postgres
